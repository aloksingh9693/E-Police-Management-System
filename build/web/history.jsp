            <p>Much before the Independence, superior police officers belonging to the   Imperial Police (IP) were appointed by the Secretary of State on the basis of   competitive examination. The very first open civil service examination for the   service was held in England</a> in June, 1893 and the   top ten candidates were appointed as probationers of the Indian (Imperial)   Police. However, it is not possible to pinpoint a date on which it could   positively be claimed that the Indian Police came into being. In around 1907,   the Secretary of State&rsquo;s officers were directed to wear the letters &quot;IP&quot; on   their epaulettes</a> to distinguish them from the other   officers not recruited by the Secretary of State. In this sense, 1907 could be   regarded as the starting point for the Indian Police.</a></p>

            <p>Prakash Singh, one of the former Director Generals of Police</a> of the   states of Assam</a> and subsequently Uttar Pradesh</a> and finally Director General of the Border Security Force</a>, initiated a   Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court of India</a>, asking the court   to investigate measures to reform the police forces across India to ensure the   proper rule of law and improve security across India.</a></p>
            <p>Several measures were identified as necessary to professionalize the police   in India:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A mid or high ranking police officer must not be transferred more frequently   than every two years. </li>
              <li>The state government cannot ask the police force to hire someone, nor can   they choose the Chief Commissioner. </li>
              <li>There must be separate departments and staff for investigation and   patrolling. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Three new authorities will be created in each state, to prevent political   interference in the police and also to make the police accountable for their   heavy-handedness,</a> which will include   the creation of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A State Security Commission for policies and direction </li>
              <li>A Police Establishment Board, which will decide the selection, promotions   and transfers of police officers and other staff </li>
              <li>A Police Complaints Authority, to inquire into allegations of police   misconduct. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In 2006, due to a lack of action by all the state governments in India, the   supreme court ordered the state governments to report to it why the reform   measures outlined were not implemented.</a> After being   questioned in front of the <a title="Judge" >udges</a> of the Supreme Court of India</a>, the state   governments are finally starting to reform the police forces and give them the   operational independence they need for fearless and proper law enforcement.</a></p></td>
